    "When I assess the statistical significance of an insight, I start by defining the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. ‚ÄãThen, I select an appropriate statistical test, such as a t-test, chi-square test, or ANOVA, depending on the data and the hypothesis. I calculate the p-value, which tells me the probability of observing the results if the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is below the predefined significance level ùõº, I conclude that the insight is statistically significant. I also ensure the sample size and assumptions of the test are valid to support the results."

    "The sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets large, regardless of the original data‚Äôs distribution. The mean of this sampling distribution is the same as the population mean, and its standard deviation is the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n",
    "This is important because it allows me to use normal distribution-based methods for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, even when the data isn‚Äôt normally distributed. It simplifies complex real-world problems and helps me draw reliable inferences from sample data."
